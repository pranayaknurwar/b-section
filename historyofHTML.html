         <p> <h2> HISTORY OF HTML </h2>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create web pages.<br> 
            It was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who is<br>
            credited with inventing the World Wide Web. Webpages can include writing, links,<br>
            pictures, and even sound and video.
            
            <h4>Tags</h4>
             HTML uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Elements <br>
             are shown as "tags" in the code, written with angle brackets: <example>.<br>
             Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content<br>
             and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. There are many kinds of<br> 
             tags, and each one has a different purpose
